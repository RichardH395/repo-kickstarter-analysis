# Kickstarter Analysis

## Overview of Project
* A deep-dive analysis that highlights key metrics and trends that provide insight, both visually and graphically, to guide decision-making for Kickstarter Campaigns

### Purpose
* Identify, highlight, and investigate what factors drive successful Kickstarter campaigns and how this can be a benchmark for future successful Kickstarter Campaigns such as Louise's Production Project: ***Fever*** 


## Analysis and Challenges
* This exploratory data analysis was performed on thousands of previous crowdfunding projects to highlight key metrics such as outcomes based on various factors such as funding goals, timelines, budgets, type of campaigns. 
* By taking the data set and using conditonal formatting and filters we can create pivot tables and pivot charts the highlight specific data that answers niche questions about these campaigns.  
* To do this I started with taking the data set and homogenizing it by freezing panes, applying filters and color coding the outcomes for successful, failed cancelled or live campaigns. After, creating new columns I created one for Years to see how each category has done over a yearly period. Taking the date conversion we created using Unix time stamp converters, we're able to focus on the years of these projects by using the Year() Function.
